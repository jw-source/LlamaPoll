# LlamaSim: 

LlamaSim is a baby (still developing!) multi-agent framework that aims to simulate human behavior at scale. Given a specific environment (e.g., voters in Pennsylvania, students at CMU), we replicate target groups, and aim to provide actionable insights for important questions/events. 

More to come...

## Roadmap
- [x] Predictive Functionality
- [x] Gradio Frontend (Local Demo)
- [ ] Live Demo
- [ ] Demographically Aligned Agents
- [ ] Long-Term Memory (maybe mem0.ai?)
- [ ] Graph Theory Approach
- [ ] Live Data Feeds for Agents (allowing them to stay up-to-date)

## Usage: 
```python
from network import Network
agent_network = Network(population="Pennsylvania Voters", num_agents=5, max_context_size=4000)
prompt = "Gas prices are an all-time high."
question = "Are you voting for Kamala Harris?"
agent_network.group_chat(prompt, "random", max_rounds=1)
agent_network.predict(prompt, question)
```
